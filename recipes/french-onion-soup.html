  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    French onion soup is a simple, warming, comfort food. It can also be time
    consuming and intimidating. This recipe will involve caramelizing onions the
    old-fashioned way; no shortcuts will be used. Make sure that you have
    oven-safe bowls for the final broil, as these will be necessary to get that
    picture-perfect layer of melted cheese on top. This recipe serves 2-4 people.
  </p>
  <p>
    The listed ingredients are meant to be the best fit for value vs.
    accessibility. If you don't have home-made stock or store-bought bone
    broth, use whatever works. The important thing is that the liquid has
    salt and is thicker than just water. If you can't find ementaler,
    gruyere, or swiss, just use a cheese that melts well and isn't too
    strong. You can add extra herbs and spices to the soup, but make sure
    that they are easy to remove by using a tea strainer or bouquet garni.
    The chief note in the soup should still be the onion. After all, we're
    working really hard on them!

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>medium-sized onions (white, yellow, or sweet) - 4 to 6</li>
    <li>unsalted butter - 2 sticks/220g</li>
    <li>water - 1 cup/240ml</li>
    <li>mineral white wine or dry red wine - half bottle/375 ml</li>
    <li>home-made chicken stock or store-bought bone broth - 32 fl oz/950ml</li>
    <li>sliced baguette - 2 to 3 slices per bowl</li>
    <li>grated gruyere, ementaler, or swiss - 8 to 12oz/225 to 340g</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat dutch oven or stockpot on low with 1 stick (110g) of butter.</li>
    <li>Slice onions into wide, meaty crescents. Make sure to remove any and all
      green layers. Add to pot once the butter has melted and cover for 15-20
      minutes or until onions have sweated and become fully translucent.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove lid, add second stick of butter, and continue to cook 30-40
      minutes or until onions are caramelized, checking and stirring every
      few minutes. If onions are browning at the edges at any point, make
      sure to deglaze the pot with a few splashes of the water.
    </li>
    <li>Add wine, and cook on medium until wine has reduced by half. Set
      the oven to broil and prepare a sheet pan with your baguette slices.
    </li>
    <li>Add stock/bone broth and heat to a simmer. While the soup is heating,
      toast baguette slices in the oven for roughly 1.5 minutes per side.
    </li>
    <li>Take pot off of heat and begin assembling your bowls of soup.
      From bottom to top: soup, toasted slices, grated cheese. Place
      bowls on the sheet pan and broil on the middle rack for 3-5 minutes
      or until cheese has melted and begun to blister.
    </li>
    <li>Let bowls cool for at least 5 minutes before serving. You can
      expedite this slightly by piercing the layer of cheese.
    </li>
  </ol>
