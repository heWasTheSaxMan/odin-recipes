  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Grilled cheese is a classic for a reason. It's simple, easy to tinker with,
    and supremely satisfying. That said, a classic struggle tends to come
    hand-in-hand with the classic sandwich: the battle between convenience and
    quality. In general, this recipe fights under the latter banner. It is the
    belief of this author that life is too short for subpar grilled cheeses.
    Note that for this recipe, the inclusion of two cheeses is non-negotiable,
    and one of them <strong>must</strong> be american. Its additives are
    precisely what we need for immaculately melted cheese. The second cheese is
    more interchangeable, provided that it still provides stronger flavor and
    can thoroughly melt. Make sure that your bread slices do not recess too much
    from the crust to the crumb. A level surface will deeply improve the quality
    and evenness of the browning.
  </p>
  <p>Allow me to abundantly clear: this recipe is still easy. It takes some extra
    time, but no step involves difficult technique or confounding ingredients.
    This is also not a recipe for a melt. This is not to say that you cannot add
    some additional goodies to these sandwiches. I only warn that the matter of
    integrating them in a pan will be left to your own discretion.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>bread - 2 slices</li>
    <li>butter, room temperature - 4 Tbsp</li>
    <li>american cheese - 1 slice torn into small pieces</li>
    <li>grated sharp white cheddar cheese - 1/2 cup</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat a large skillet on medium-low heat.</li>
    <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread from edge to edge. Be sure to get full
      coverage.
    </li>
    <li>Place both slices butter-side-down on the skillet, and nudge them around
      to help depress the crust. Heat until browned (around 3 minutes) and remove.
    </li>
    <li>Butter the remaining sides of the bread, place one slice on the skillet
      butter-side-down, and nudge it around as per the previous step. Atop this
      slice, arange you cheese such that both types are both reasonably
      intermingled and distributed evenly. Place the remaining bread slice on top
      of the cheese toast-side-down, and then cover the skillet.
    </li>
    <li>Continue heating the sandwich for roughly 3 minutes, or until the bottom
      is golden brown. Then flip the sandwich, nudge it around, cover the skillet
      again, and cook until the final side is golden brown (roughly 3 minutes).
    </li>
    <li>Remove the sandwich and let cool for at least one minute before serving.</li>
  </ol>
