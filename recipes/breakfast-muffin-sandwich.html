  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Do you frequently find yourself dazed and lethargic late in the morning?
    I know that I used to, until I realized I needed more protein for breakfast.
    Confounding this problem, I was normally short on time before having to rush
    for work. Thankfully I found a solution in the form of an unbranded tribute
    to a famous fast-food breakfast sandwich.
  </p>
  <p>
    These breakfast (english) muffin sandwiches can be made in one pan in only
    a few minutes, and can come with you on your way out the door. While they
    may not be vegan or vegetarian out of the gate, nearly every ingredient can
    be substituted for a compatible alternative. These are meant to be eaten hot.
    While it may be tempting to try and reheat these, I don't recommend it. This
    recipe is scaled to only one sandwich, but you might find yourself making a
    full stack if you're not careful.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>English Muffin - 1 bun</li>
    <li>Butter - 1 Tbsp</li>
    <li>Salt - 1 dash</li>
    <li>Large Egg - 2</li>
    <li>Sausage Patty - 2</li>
    <li>American Cheese - 1 slice</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat a medium (10.5") saucepan on medium heat, then add butter.
      Distribute butter around pan once melted.
    </li>
    <li>Place both halves of the muffin face-down on the pan, and toast for about 2 minutes</li>
    <li>
      Remove buns from heat and reserve. Add sausage patties and cook until heated through,
      about 5 minutes. While sausage is cooking, beat your eggs in a small bowl with the
      dash of salt.
    </li>
    <li>Remove sausage and place on top of the muffin halves.</li>
    <li>Add egg to pan and distribute evenly. Once a curd begins to form, place each
      muffin half with sausage face-down on top of the eggs.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the curd has solidified, flip all of the ingredients (which by now
      should be bound together by the egg). Imagine a hinge between either
      half of the muffin. First fold any egg in excess of the width of the
      hinge inward. Then place the slice of american cheese on top of your
      bottom bun. Finally, fold the sandwich hinge-wise and remove from heat.
      Serve immediately.
    </li>

  </ol>
